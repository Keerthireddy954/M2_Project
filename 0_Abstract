This simple fingerprint door unlock project using Arduino can be very useful for door security, forensics, crime investigation, personal identification, attendance system and much more. In the future, there could be many more applications like fingerprint based driving licences, bank accounts operation and so on.

The whole system works under a simple algorithm called matching algorithm, which is used to compare previously-stored templates of fingerprints against usersâ€™ fingerprints for authentication purposes.
